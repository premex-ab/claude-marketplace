# android-android-cli

> Provides instructions for installing and using the `android` CLI. The `android` command-line tool is a critical tool for Android development and helps you create new Android projects, run Android apps on devices, manage and interact with Android virtual devices (including screenshots and UI inspection), manage Android SDK components, look up official Android documentation, and discover and install official Android skills.

**Upstream:** [`android/skills/devtools/android-cli`](https://github.com/android/skills/tree/main/devtools/android-cli) — mirrored and split into a one-plugin-per-skill layout so you can install skills individually. Auto-synced daily from upstream; the SKILL.md is Google-authored.

## Install

```bash
/plugin install android-android-cli@premex-plugins
```

## What's in the box

- `skills/android-cli/SKILL.md` — the skill definition
- `skills/android-cli/references/` — supporting docs referenced from the skill
- `LICENSE.txt` — upstream Apache-2.0 license text

## Why this repo instead of cloning upstream?

The [top-level README](../../README.md#-android----googles-official-android-agent-skills) explains the rationale in detail. In short: upstream ships one monolithic repo of skills; this repo splits them into individually-installable plugins and auto-syncs daily.

## License

Apache-2.0 — see [`LICENSE.txt`](LICENSE.txt). The skill content is Google-authored; this directory is a packaging wrapper maintained by the Premex marketplace sync.
